# How to use this folder
Place all vendor dependencies in folders, named after their respective authors. 

EX:
- Jquery: /vendor/jquery/jquery.min.js

## Blazed Standard
All vendor dependencies also include their project's LICENSE file, as well as a file simply named "VERSION", which contains in plain text the version of the dependency at the time of download.
